# Object Oriented Programming Lab - Java

As the name suggests, this repo contains programs in Java. Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function. 

Let us do discuss pre-requisites by polishing concepts of methods declaration and passing. Starting off with the method declaration, it consists of six components: 

#### Access Modifiers : 
Defines access type of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application. In Java, there 4 type of the access specifiers:- 
- public : accessible in all class in your application.
- protected : accessible within the package in which it is defined and in its subclass(es)(including subclasses declared outside the package)
- private : accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
- default (declared/defined without using any modifier): accessible within same class and package within which its class is defined.


#### OOPs Concepts are as follows : 

- Class
- Object 
- Method and method passing
- Pillars of OOPS
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Compile-time polymorphism
- Run-time polymorphism
